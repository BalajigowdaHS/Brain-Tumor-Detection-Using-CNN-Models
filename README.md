# Project Overview
The advent of deep learning technology has significantly advanced the field of medical imaging, particularly in the detection of brain tumors. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), a powerful deep learning algorithm, offer the capability to analyze MRI scans with high precision and efficiency. By automating the detection process, CNN models reduce the time required for manual image interpretation while also minimizing the risk of human error, ultimately leading to better patient outcomes.

This project aims to develop a CNN-based model using the PyTorch framework to accurately detect brain tumors from MRI images. By training on a dataset of labeled brain tumor images, the model will learn to identify specific patterns associated with tumor presence, making it a valuable tool to support healthcare professionals in the diagnosis process.
